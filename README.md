# Examples

This is a collection of examples as a quick reference to various languages and
systems.  The examples should reflect features of the language and common
approaches to a solution.  You should be able to read it from begining to end
and it should read like a tutorial.

The files are written with the extension of the language used so you can open
it in your text editor with full syntax highlighting.
